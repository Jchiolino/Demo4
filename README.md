# By Kitt/rapidrecharge/jchiolino

## Overview
This demo highlights RPG Maker MV’s battle system with a focus on **custom skills, spells, buffs, debuffs, and boss behavior**.  
The goal is to demonstrate control over combat design, flow, and encounter balancing.

## Features

### Skills
- Physical attacks include:
  - Single-target strikes  
  - Random multi-hits (same or different enemies)  
  - All-enemy attacks  
- Skills are divided between Harold and Therese to create class variety.

### Spells
- Non-physical options such as:
  - An area-of-effect (AOE) fire spell  
  - An agility buff spell  
  - A magic attack buff spell  
- Showcases how magic can supplement physical roles.

### Buffs
- Examples include:
  - Increasing agility  
  - Boosting magic attack  
  - Boss-exclusive buff: increases attack but lowers defense  

### Debuffs
- **Burn:** a damage-over-time effect that reduces HP each turn  
- **Armor Break:** lowers the target’s defense for a limited duration  

### Boss Encounter
- Uses different tactics at HP thresholds (⅔ and ⅓ health).  
- Incorporates:
  - Physical skill usage  
  - Summoning additional mobs  
  - A unique **Enrage** ability exclusive to the boss  
- Rewards players for timing and prioritizing correctly.

## Extras

## Why It Matters
This demo demonstrates:
- Ability to design **turn-based combat mechanics**.  
- Understanding of **buff/debuff strategy** and **enemy phases**.  
- Awareness of **player experience and pacing** in combat.  

## Bossfight video
I couldn't fit the video into the GitHub, so I uploaded it to YouTube instead.
